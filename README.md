# Micro Service IoT Home Project (better name to come)

A pratice project to keep my programming skills more up to date. If you see anything that can help or that you think is wrong, feel free to reach out. The project is a hobby project and will probably never be finished.

Currently I will be focusing on the following topcis and technologies:

- Micro Service Architecture and Principles
- Messaging using Kafka
- Python for backend services
- React for frontend development
- Docker
- Test Driven Development
